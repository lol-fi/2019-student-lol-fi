# Silly Idea 1

A private app that is like a blog. It is very similar to tumblr, twitter or any other 
blog except there is no public landing page. It is private to the user and has a timeline.
A user can share a single entry with any other individual, but can only share one at a time.
The app prompts the user two or three times a day to answer simple questions that are
intended to make them more mindful of what is going on around them and keep a record
of their life. 

# Silly Idea 2
A tracking app but tracks silly things. There is a different thing that the user
tracks each month. The app prompts the user to fill in a bubble or graph depending
on what is being tracked each day. At the end of the year, you have a bunch
of random data about your life.

# Silly Idea 3
Daily photos app. You can take a photo of the same thing every day, like your
plants growing or yourself, and it compiles them into gifs at regular intervals.
For example, you can take a picture of a renovation and have it a transformation
gif or take a picture of your plants growing.
