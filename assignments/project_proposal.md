# Elevator Pitch

People today are tired of always performing for others. Most blogging apps are for
sharing. But I think people want something different. The popularity of apps like 
Headspace and Calm show that people want to live a more mindful lives, but they
still want their mobile devices to be a part of that. I think a blogging app that
focuses on being mindful, living in the moment, and creating meaningful memories of
the small moments in day-to-day life that make it what it is would be a welcome
change.

# Problem

People are tired of apps that want them to perform socially, and they are tired
at looking at other people's curated lives that present an idealized view of
their day-to-day. People want something that is more real, and that will let
them connect to themselves and create and map a rich inner world.

## Introduction to Domain

<!-- TODO -->

# Solution

A private app that guides users to add entries once or twice a day
with prompts that increase mindfulness. We want to help users capture
their life and create memories. People are looking to connect with the smaller
things in life, and the day to day, and make the most of modern technology to
document their life. 

## Architecture Overview

## User Stories

As someone feeling burnt out on modern life but wanting
to still live in and enjoy the modern world, I choose
private blogging to help me architect a more mindful life,
cultivate gratefulness, and live in the moment.

# Viability

All features of this app are pretty standard of other apps.
The tasks needed are:
- Send notifications to user
- Access camera, mic
- Make posts with videos, photos, text and audio
- Keep a personal timeline
- Send private link to other users (password or key protected)

## Hardware

This will be an app for Android phones

## APIs

* Android SDK

## Tools

* IntelliJ
* Android SDK
* Java JDK

## Proof of Concept

Blogging platforms that do all the functions of what we have already exist, but
they are targetted at a different type of user. The popularity of more
private apps, like snapchat, where users can choose a one-on-one interaction
rather than a one-on-many interaction shows that people are wanting a break
from social performance, and a more authentic way of interacting and
documenting their days.

# Difficulty

The difficulty here will be to keep the app sufficiently engaging without 
trying to manipulate people with social rewards like a popularity contest or give them dopamine
hits with "likes".

# Market Research

## Users

People who enjoy blogging and are looking for a way to do that with less
pressure of performance. People who want to live a more mindful life. People
who still want to use modern technology to make memories and document their life
but also are seeking more privacy. 

## Competition

The competition is existing blogging platforms. On many of these, private
blogging already exists. We will be different because we aren't just offering
a private blog feature - we are offering a different way of interacting with 
the concept of blogging - a more gentle, mindful, way that people are looking
for.
